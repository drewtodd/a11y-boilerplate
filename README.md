## Accessibility Best Practices
📌 **Images:** Use meaningful `alt` text, and avoid empty `alt` attributes unless the image is purely decorative.
📌 **Links:** Use descriptive link text (e.g., "Read More" ➝ "Read More About Web Accessibility").
📌 **Forms:** Always use `<label>` elements for inputs, and provide clear validation/error messages.
📌 **Focus Management:** Ensure interactive elements have a visible focus state.
📌 **Keyboard Navigation:** All functionality should be operable via keyboard (`Tab`, `Enter`, `Space` keys).
